This is the code to create the summary sheets of the CAMELS-spat dataset (https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2025-893)

- installPackages.R must be run once in order to install all the packages needed to reproduce this work.

- 01_EXAMPLE contain the data necessary to create the summary sheets for the Grande Rivere catchment at Violette Bridge (CAN_01AF007)

- 02_SCRIPT contains the main script that can run on a computer (01_SummarySheets.R) or on a cluster (01_SummarySheets_Cluster.R + 01_SummarySheets_Cluster.slurm). Both of them are set up to run only the exemple here.

- 03_OUTPUTS contains the outputs, i.e. the summary sheets (here only for the example).
